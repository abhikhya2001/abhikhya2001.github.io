Hello, I am Abhikhya. I'm a Research Associate at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). Previously, I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP)](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in) with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, and a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. My research interests are broadly in Computer Vision and Multimodal Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in developing rich representations for multimodal data to empower scalable solutions for practical applications.
